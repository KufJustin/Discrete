My name is Justin Siregar and I am currently a third-year student here at California State University San Bernardino. I enjoy playing video games and even more so I like to make mods to open source video games. This is because the community surrounding whichever game I am modding can relay feedback directly to me and describe the problems to me. Some Of he games of my choice are Counter-Strike Global Offensive, Garry's Mod, and Grand Theft Auto Five. When I am not working on a mod I am usually watching NBA games or spending the time outside to play basketball. I hope to develope my coding journey to be able to create successfull video games one day.
